FAVICON FILES NEEDED:

The following favicon files need to be created and placed in the public directory:

1. apple-touch-icon.png (180x180px) - For iOS devices
2. favicon-16x16.png (16x16px) - Standard favicon
3. favicon-32x32.png (32x32px) - Standard favicon

You can generate these files from your logo or brand mark using:
- Online favicon generators like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
- Design tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Canva
- Command line tools like ImageMagick

Recommended approach:
1. Use your brand's primary color (#2563eb) as the base
2. Create a simple icon representing AI/call center QA (could be a speech bubble, AI brain, or quality checkmark)
3. Generate multiple sizes from a single SVG source

Color scheme: #2563eb (brand blue) on white background
